# Overview

A skill used when starting a template repository as a new project.
Initializes `docs/domain/` for the specific project through a single interview session.

# Execution Steps

## Step 1: Consolidated Interview

Gather the following in a single round of questions:

1. Project name (display name / identifier)
2. Problem to solve and value proposition
3. Target users
4. In Scope / Out of Scope
5. Key entities (3-5)
6. MVP use cases (3-5)
7. Glossary (ubiquitous language)
8. Open questions and decision deadlines

## Step 2: Initialize docs/domain

Based on the responses, update the following:

- `docs/domain/overview.md`
- `docs/domain/entities.md`
- `docs/domain/usecases.md`
- `docs/domain/glossary.md`
- `docs/domain/decisions.md`

Do not leave open questions as `TBD`; instead, record them as discussion points in `usecases.md` or `decisions.md`.

## Step 3: Pre-Implementation Check

After updating, clarify and present the following:

1. Scope to implement in MVP
2. Scope to defer
3. Next decisions to make (with deadlines)
